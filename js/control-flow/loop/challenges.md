Understood. **No hints.**
Just **10 challenges** that force choosing the correct loop.

## **10 Loop Challenges**

1. Print every element in this array:

```js
const names = ["Zeha", "Rizky", "Tama"];
```

2. Print every key and value in this object:

```js
const profile = { username: "zeha", level: 7, premium: true };
```

3. Print numbers from 1 to 50, but stop the loop when the number reaches 23.

4. Keep generating a random number (1–10) until the number equals 5. Print each generated number.

5. Ask the user for input once, and continue asking again **only** if the input is empty.

6. Create a new array that contains each number from the original array multiplied by 3:

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
```

7. Create a new array that contains only the strings:

```js
const mixed = [10, "JS", true, "Node", null, "React"];
```

8. Calculate the total value of all items:

```js
const prices = [200, 150, 350, 100];
```

9. Add `+10` to each element directly (modify in place):

```js
let scores = [40, 50, 60];
```

10. For a list of HTML elements, attach a click event to each:

```js
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");
```
