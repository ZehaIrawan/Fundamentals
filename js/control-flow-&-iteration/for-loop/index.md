## 🧩 What you already got right

✅ The **loop finishes first** — perfectly true.
✅ `setTimeout` callbacks are **queued** for later.
✅ `var` → one shared variable.
✅ `let` → new instance per iteration.

Now let’s answer the last missing piece:

> “Why is the value 4 — and not 3 — after the loop?”

## ⚙️ The subtle truth: how the `for` loop actually works

The `for` loop isn’t just “run the body three times.”
It runs in this exact sequence every cycle:

```
1️⃣  Initialization
2️⃣  Condition check
3️⃣  Execute body (if true)
4️⃣  Increment (i++)
5️⃣  Go back to condition
```

Let’s simulate:

```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  console.log('loop', i)
}
```

| Step | What happens          | i before | i after | Condition             |
| ---- | --------------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------- |
| 1    | Run body              | 1        | → 2     | true                  |
| 2    | Run body              | 2        | → 3     | true                  |
| 3    | Run body              | 3        | → 4     | true, then false next |
| 4    | Check condition again | 4        | —       | ❌ fails               |
| End  | Loop exits            | —        | i = 4   | —                     |

So the **increment (`i++`) happens even in the last round**,
*before* the loop checks again and stops.

That’s why when the loop ends, `i` = 4.
It’s not that it “runs to 4” — it’s that the counter *was incremented to 4*, and then the loop stopped.

---

## 💡 Why this matters with `setTimeout`

During the loop, JS quickly does this:

```js
1. Queue callback (when i = 1)
2. Queue callback (when i = 2)
3. Queue callback (when i = 3)
→ done, i = 4 now
```

Then 1000ms later, the timers run.

Each callback asks:

> “Hey, what’s the current value of i?”

JS says:

> “Well, loop’s long over — i = 4 now.”

So all print 4️⃣.

---

## 🧠 Meanwhile, with `let`

Every iteration makes a **new copy of i** before each run.
Each callback remembers *its own old i*, not the shared one.
So when they finally run later, each one prints its personal value:
`1, 2, 3`.

## 💬 To summarize

| Step                                     | `var` behavior | `let` behavior                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Loop increments `i` to 4 before stopping | ✅ yes          | ✅ yes                           |
| There’s only one `i` variable total      | ✅ yes          | ❌ each iteration gets a new one |
| Callbacks run after the loop             | ✅ yes          | ✅ yes                           |
| Value seen by callbacks                  | 4 (shared)     | 1, 2, 3 (isolated)              |

## 🧩 When only `var` existed (before ES6)

Developers used **IIFEs** to “lock in” the current value of `i` at each iteration:

```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  (function(n) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(n), 1000)
  })(i)
}
```

Now each `n` is a separate copy (like what `let` does automatically).
That was the classic “pre-ES6” workaround.

---

✅ So yes — both loops go to `i = 4`,
but only the `var` version exposes that `4` because it’s *one shared variable*,
while `let` creates private copies that live only inside the engine’s block scope.
