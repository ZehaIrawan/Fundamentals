this is a special keyword that automatically refers to something different depending on how a function is called, not where it‚Äôs written.

Think of this as:

‚ÄúWho called me?‚Äù

It points to the object that owns the function at the time it‚Äôs executed.

2. But arrow functions changed the landscape

Arrow functions don‚Äôt have their own this,
so in many modern use cases (especially in functional / React / Node code),
you don‚Äôt need to worry about rebinding this anymore.

| Area                      | Why it‚Äôs still used                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Classes**               | `this` refers to instance fields & methods                               |
| **OOP frameworks / SDKs** | Many APIs rely on methods using `this` (e.g., Node, Three.js, Sequelize) |
| **Event handlers (DOM)**  | `this` = the element clicked                                             |
| **Legacy / ES5 code**     | A lot of existing web apps still depend on `this`                        |

üß© 4. Where it‚Äôs less common

Modern JS often avoids this in favor of:

- Arrow functions ‚Üí use lexical scope

- Modules + closures ‚Üí encapsulate state

- Functional programming patterns (React, Next.js, Svelte, etc.)
