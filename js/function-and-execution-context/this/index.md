2. But arrow functions changed the landscape

Arrow functions donâ€™t have their own this,
so in many modern use cases (especially in functional / React / Node code),
you donâ€™t need to worry about rebinding this anymore.

| Area                      | Why itâ€™s still used                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Classes**               | `this` refers to instance fields & methods                               |
| **OOP frameworks / SDKs** | Many APIs rely on methods using `this` (e.g., Node, Three.js, Sequelize) |
| **Event handlers (DOM)**  | `this` = the element clicked                                             |
| **Legacy / ES5 code**     | A lot of existing web apps still depend on `this`                        |

ðŸ§© 4. Where itâ€™s less common

Modern JS often avoids this in favor of:

- Arrow functions â†’ use lexical scope

- Modules + closures â†’ encapsulate state

- Functional programming patterns (React, Next.js, Svelte, etc.)
