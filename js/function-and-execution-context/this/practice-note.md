## üß© **Challenge 1 ‚Äì Object Method**

### My answer
```js
const greetFn = user.greet
greetFn.bind(user)
greetFn() // ‚ùì what happens here?
```

It failed because .bind() does not mutate the original function.
It returns a new version with a permanently fixed this.

=> .bind() makes a new function where this is permanently set to the object you choose.

Correct
```js
const greetFn = user.greet.bind(user)
greetFn() // ‚ùì what happens here?
```

// this belong to the greet function
// which is undefined
// binding should happen before the call

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Challenge 2 ‚Äì Arrow Function vs Regular Function**
### **Goal:** Understand that arrow functions *don‚Äôt have their own* `this`.

Regular: Dinda
Arrow: undefined

// ## üñ± **Challenge 3 ‚Äì Event Handler in Browser**

// ### **Goal:** Learn what `this` points to in DOM events.

```js
const {JSDOM} = require('jsdom')

const dom = new JSDOM(`<!DOCTYPE html><body></body>`)
const document = dom.window.document




const button = document.createElement('button')
button.textContent = "Click Me"
document.body.appendChild(button)

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log("Clicked:", this.textContent)
})

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log("Arrow Clicked:", this.textContent)
})


button.click()
```


// **üß† Task:**
// 1Ô∏è‚É£ Click the button ‚Äî what prints for both logs?
// 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why does one show `"Click Me"` and the other `undefined`?

// üí° *Hint:* In event listeners, `function()` binds `this` to the element, but arrow functions don‚Äôt.

Clicked: Click Me
Arrow Clicked: undefined

## üîÅ **Challenge 4 ‚Äì Class and `this`**

### **Goal:** Understand `this` inside class methods.

```js
class Counter {
  count = 0

  increase() {
    this.count++
    console.log(this.count)
  }
}

// instance of counter
const counter = new Counter()

// variable hold a function of increase
const inc = counter.increase
inc() // ‚ùì what happens here?
```

**üß† Task:**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Predict the output.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Fix it so `inc()` works correctly even when detached.

üí° *Hint:* Use an arrow function or `.bind(this)` in the constructor.

# Answer
the value of this gets lost, so it doesn't work as you expect.
const inc = counter.increase   // <-- we only copied the function, not the object

To make it work you can
1. bind the function to the class instance
 const inc = counter.increase.bind(counter)

2. modify the increase function to use arrow function
  // increase = () => {
  //   this.count++
  //   console.log(this.count)
  // }

  // i get the first one, explain why 2nd work, i thought arrow function dont have this

//   This increase is not a method on the prototype anymore.
// It is a property on the instance, created during construction.

// And since arrow functions don‚Äôt create their own this,
// they capture this from their surrounding scope.

// Here, the surrounding scope is the class instance itself, because this code runs inside the constructor context.

## Normal function ‚Üí this determined at call time 
- Meaning: whoever is on the left side of the dot becomes this.
- normal functions don‚Äôt automatically inherit this.
- And plain functions have this = undefined (in strict mode) or this = window (in browser non-strict mode).

## Arrow function ‚Üí this determined at creation time
   Instead, it captures this from where it was originally written (lexical binding).


Arrow functions do not have their own this.
Instead, they capture this from where they are defined (lexical this).

increase is an arrow function, so this is lexically bound to the instance of the class at creation time. Even when we assign increase to another variable and call it, this still refers to the counter instance. Therefore calling inc() increments counter.count and prints 1.

Because increase is defined using an arrow function, it captures this lexically from the instance. So even when assigned to inc, it still refers to the original counter object. Calling inc() increments counter.count and logs 1.

## üßÆ **Challenge 5 ‚Äì setTimeout and Lost Context**

### **Goal:** Learn how `this` behaves in async callbacks.

```js
const car = {
  brand: "Tesla",
  start: function() {
    console.log("Starting", this.brand)
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log("Inside timeout:", this.brand)
    }, 1000)
  }
}

car.start()
```

**üß† Task:**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Predict the two console logs.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Fix it so both logs print `"Tesla"`.

üí° *Hint:* Arrow function inside `setTimeout` inherits the outer `this`.

The start method has the correct this because it is called as car.start().
But the setTimeout callback is a regular function, so its this is not inherited from start().
Regular functions get this from how they are called, and here it‚Äôs called without a context, so this becomes undefined.
Using an arrow function fixes it because arrow functions capture this from where they are defined.
