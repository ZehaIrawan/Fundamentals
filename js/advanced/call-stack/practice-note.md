🔥 Excellent — you caught exactly what makes the **call stack** concept click.
Let’s break down **why** that output happens:

---

### 🧩 Code Recap

```js
function first() {
  console.log("First start")
  second()
  console.log("First end")
}

function second() {
  console.log("Second start")
  third()
  console.log("Second end")
}

function third() {
  console.log("Third")
}

first()
```

### ⚙️ Step-by-step: How the Call Stack Executes

When you run JavaScript, there’s a **Call Stack** —
a data structure that tracks **what function is currently running** and **where to return** after it finishes.

Let’s simulate it 👇

---

### 🪜 Step 1: Start `first()`

Stack:

```
[first]
```

🖨️ Output: `First start`

Then inside `first()`, we call `second()`.

---

### 🪜 Step 2: Call `second()`

Stack:

```
[first]
[second]
```

🖨️ Output: `Second start`

Then inside `second()`, we call `third()`.

---

### 🪜 Step 3: Call `third()`

Stack:

```
[first]
[second]
[third]
```

🖨️ Output: `Third`

`third()` doesn’t call anything else, so it **finishes** → its frame is **popped** off the stack.

Stack after pop:

```
[first]
[second]
```

---

### 🪜 Step 4: Back to `second()`

Now the engine returns to the line *after* `third()` inside `second()`.

🖨️ Output: `Second end`

`second()` is now finished → pop it off.

Stack after pop:

```
[first]
```

---

### 🪜 Step 5: Back to `first()`

Now it continues *after* `second()` inside `first()`.

🖨️ Output: `First end`

Then `first()` finishes → stack is now empty.

Stack after pop:

```
(empty)
```

---

### ✅ Final Output Order

```
First start
Second start
Third
Second end
First end
```

---

### 🧠 Why This Happens

Because **JavaScript is single-threaded** and executes code **depth-first** —
it *always* goes **into a function completely** before coming back out.

Think of it like:

> “Finish what’s inside before you continue.”

### 🔍 Visualization

```
[Call Stack Timeline]

┌──────────────┐
│ third()      │ ← runs last in, finishes first
│ second()     │ ← waits until third() finishes
│ first()      │ ← waits until second() finishes
└──────────────┘
```

LIFO (Last In, First Out) — exactly like stacking plates 🥞.

If you want, I can show a **diagram animation** (stack push/pop per step)
or give you a **mental trick** to remember stack order forever (“inside-out” execution rule).
Want me to show that next?
