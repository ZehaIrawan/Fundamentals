closures are one of the most powerful concepts in JS â€” theyâ€™re how React hooks, debouncing, and private variables work.

ðŸ¥‰ 1. Counter Factory
Concept: closure remembering internal state.

hallenge: make createCounter() that remembers its count.
```js
function createCounter() {
  // your code here
}
```

ðŸ§  Hint: use a variable inside createCounter() that increments each time the inner function runs.
