| **1️⃣ Callback**      | The foundation of async JS — how JS “waits” for things | Helps you understand *why* we even need Promises      |
| **2️⃣ Promise**       | Makes async easier to manage than nested callbacks     | Teaches chaining, error handling, and microtask queue |
| **3️⃣ async / await** | Cleaner syntax built *on top of Promises*              | Feels synchronous but runs asynchronously             |
