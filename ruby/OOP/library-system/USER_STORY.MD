📚 Library System — User Stories

🧑‍💼 As a Librarian:
1. I want to add books to the library catalog so that users can borrow them.
2. I want to remove books from the catalog when they are outdated or lost.
3. I want to view the current list of available books so I can manage the inventory.
4. I want to track which users have borrowed which books to ensure returns are followed up.
5. (Optional) I want to limit the number of books each user can borrow to manage stock fairly.

👩‍🎓 As a User (Library Member):
1. I want to browse the list of available books so I can choose what to borrow.
2. I want to borrow a book from the library if it’s available.
3. I want to return a book once I’m done reading it.
4. I want to see a list of books I’ve currently borrowed so I can keep track.
5. (Optional) I want to know if a book I want is already borrowed by someone else.

🏛️ As the Library System:
1. I need to track the inventory of books — what's available and what's checked out.
2. I need to associate each borrowed book with a user for accountability.
3. I need to prevent users from borrowing books that are unavailable.
4. I need to restore books to the available list when returned.
5. (Optional) I need to persist data (e.g., save/load to a file) so the library state isn’t lost between sessions.
